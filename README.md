<h1> Python </h1>
 
 
 1. What are the data types in Python and how do they differ from other programming languages?

ANS--->

1.String - a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes.


2.Integer -   an integer is a whole number (positive, negative, or zero) without a decimal point. 


3.flot -  a float is a number with a decimal point.



4.List - List is an Ordered sequence of items.Declaring a list is, items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets[].

5.Tupple -   Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list. the only difference is that tuples are immutable. tuples once created cannot be modified. --> ()


6.Dictionary -  a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. Dictionaries are represented using the 'dict'



2. How do you define and call a function in Python?

Ans. Function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

Function help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, function make it more organized and manageable.

It avoids repetition and makes code reusable.


Function Call- Once we have defined a function, we can call it from anywhere


3. What are the control structures in Python and how do they work?

Ans. there are three main types of control structures:

1.Conditional statements - Conditional statements are used to execute certain blocks of code only if a certain condition is true. In Python, the if statement is used for this purpose.


2. Loops: Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

----> for loops: for loops are used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

----> while loops: while loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.

3. Exception handling: Exception handling: Exception handling is used to handle errors and other exceptional events that may occur during the execution of a program. In Python, you can use the try, except, else, and finally keywords to handle exceptions.



4. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
 
Ans. the main differences between a list and a tuple in Python are:

1. Mutability: lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.
2. Syntax: lists use square brackets, tuples use parentheses.
3. Performance: lists are faster for modifying elements, tuples are faster for accessing elements.


5. What is a dictionary in Python and how do you use it?

ans. a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. Dictionaries are represented using the 'dict'.

You can use a dictionary in Python by creating it using curly braces "{ }" and separating each key-value pair with a colon ::"


6. What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?

ans-->
In Python, copying an object can be done using either a shallow copy or a deep copy. The main differences between the two are:

Shallow Copy: Creates a new object, but only copies the references of the original object's nested objects. Changes made to the nested objects in the new object will also affect the original object.

Deep Copy: Creates a new object, and recursively copies all of the nested objects in the original object. Changes made to the nested objects in the new object will not affect the original object.


7. What is object-oriented programming and how does it relate to Python?
ans. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and manipulate data. OOP provides a way to organize and structure code by bundling data and functions that operate on that data into objects.

In Python, everything is an object, including integers, strings, and functions. This means that Python supports OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You can create your own classes in Python using the class keyword, and then create objects (also called instances) of those classes to work with.



8. pass keyword in python?
Ans. When the user does not know what code to write, So user simply places a pass at that line. 

9. continue and break keyword?

ans. In programming, the continue and break keywords are used to control the flow of execution within loops.

The continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that any remaining code within the current iteration is skipped, and the loop moves on to the next iteration. This keyword is commonly used to skip certain iterations based on a particular condition.


10. How do you handle errors and exceptions in Python?

try:
	num = int(input("Enter a Number"))
	print(num)

except:
	print("invailed Input")

<h1> API </h1>
<p>
APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.
